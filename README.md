MY RENDERER

In attempt to learn c++ and opengl, i'm workign through two resources to build a renderer: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2 & https://learnopengl.com/
My code reflects a blend between these two resources and in some cases uniquely built abstractions inspired from the two of them.
Following the completion of these resources, I plan to extend my renderer to include my own features
