MY RENDERER

In attempt to learn c++ and opengl, i'm workign through two resources to build a renderer: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2 & https://learnopengl.com/
My code reflects a blend between these two resources and in some cases uniquely built abstractions inspired from the two of them.
Following the completion of these resources, I plan to extend my renderer to include my own features


HOW TO BUILD:
1. need to clone and build glm from source, so that it will be detected in the cmake file
2. clone and build glfw from source. This will be need to copied intothe project hierarchy manually (not detected by cmake (thought i wonder if it could).
